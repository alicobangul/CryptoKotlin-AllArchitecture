# About
When the application is first launched, the user is asked which architecture they want to use. Then, it is checked using the Room library whether there is any data stored in the database. If there is no data stored in the database or if SwipeRefreshLayout is executed after retrieving the data from the database, an API call is made with the Retrofit library.

The main purpose of the project is to explain the working principles of architectures to developers.
